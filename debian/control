Description: Go package for working with Merkle trees
 Calculate merkle roots, build and verify proofs that data is in a
 merkle tree (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree).
 .
 Specifically, this package is designed to facilitate the generation and
 verification of "Merkle proofs" â€” cryptographic proofs that a given subset
 of data "belongs" to a larger set. BitTorrent, for example, requires
 downloading many small pieces of a file from many untrusted peers; Merkle
 proofs allow the downloader to verify that each piece is part of the full
 file.
 .
 When sha256 is used as the hashing algorithm, the implementation matches
 the merkle tree described in RFC 6962, 'Certificate Transparency'.
